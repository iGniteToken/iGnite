# iGniter


Our token seeks to enable users to specify which type of Ethereum based token they would like to issue. We currently provide support for ERC20 and ERC223 based tokens as these are the most common and widely adopted token standards. In the future, as new token standards are developed we intend to implement them into our token creation service.

In addition to token creation, our service allows users to transfer, burn and mint new tokens. We strive to make token management as user friendly as possible as we firmly believe user friendliness is one main factor that is currently limiting mainstream adoption.

Every time the iGniter Token Creation Service is used, iGniter tokens are burnt as this feature is built into the iGniter service payment function. This will in turn reduce the total supply of iGniter.

Anyone can effectively self-mine iGniter, even if they missed out on the bounty distribution by calling the smart contract.

There are several ways to self-mine iGniter.

    By calling the claimDividends function
    By calling the HODLRegistration function and owning 100k or more INR
    By calling any of the five Tier functions and sending the specified amount of Ethereum
